title: Pivotal Web Services Performance During Upgrade
owner: CloudOps
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides sample performance measurements of a Cloud Foundry installation undergoing the workload associated with an upgrade. 

To obtain these measurements, Pivotal repaved its production Pivotal Web Services (PWS) deployment. The repave process simulates system load that would be incurred when performing a rolling upgrade of Diego cells.

Use the measurements and configuration values published in this document as guidance when ensuring you have adequate file storage hardware prior to a platform upgrade.

For more information about the impact of upgrade on file storage performance, see [Upgrade Considerations for Selecting File Storage in Pivotal Cloud Foundry](./storage_considerations.html).

## <a id="configuration"></a> Platform Configuration

The following table details the starting parameters and configuration of PWS.

## <a id="during_upgrade"></a> System Performance Measurements During Cell Repave

This table presents performance measurements taken during the Diego cell repave. 

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: These measurements indicate the peak cumulative values of the entire system (250 Diego cells, ~15,000 application instances, and 2 AZs.)</p>

Use these measurements as a baseline for expected system load during Diego cell upgrade.

## <a id="graph"></a> Sample Performance Graphs

These DataDog graphs represent a timeline visualization of read and write operations during the repave event. 

### <a id="graph_readops"></a> Read I/O Operations

The read I/O operations sample was taken over 115 VMs and represent the number of read operations over 300 seconds for a single Diego cell.

<%= image_tag("pws_read_ops_upgrade.png") %>

### <a id="graph_writeops"></a> Write I/O Operations

The write I/O operations sample was taken over 115 VMs and represent the number of write I/O operations over 300 seconds for a single Diego cell.

<%= image_tag("pws_write_ops_upgrade.png") %>

## <a id="summary"></a> Summary

During the repave process, 250 Diego cells were updated. The repave process took 6 hours overall or about 3 hours for each Availability Zone.
