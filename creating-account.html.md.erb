title: Creating New PAS User Accounts
owner: Identity
---

When you first deploy Pivotal Application Service (PAS), there is only one user: an administrator. At this point, you can add accounts for new users who can then push apps using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

How to add users depends on whether or not you have SMTP enabled, as described in the options below.


## <a id='smtp'></a> Option 1: Adding New Users when SMTP Is Enabled

If you have enabled SMTP, your users can sign up for accounts and create their own orgs. They do this using the [<%= vars.product_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) Apps Manager, a self-service tool for managing organizations, users, app, and app spaces.

Instruct users to complete the following steps to log in and get started using Apps Manager.

1. Browse to `apps.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`. See the **Domains** pane in the PAS tile to locate your system domain.

1. Select **Create an Account**.

1. Enter your email address and click **Create an Account**. When your account is ready, Apps Manager sends you a new account email.

1. When you receive the new account email, follow the link in the email to complete your registration.

1. You will be asked to choose your organization name.

You now have access to the Apps Manager. For more information about using Apps Manager, see the [Apps Manager documentation](../console/index.html).


## <a id='admin'></a> Option 2: Adding New Users when SMTP Is Not Enabled

If you have not enabled SMTP, only an administrator can create new users, and there is no self-service facility for users to sign up for accounts or create orgs.

The administrator creates users with the cf CLI. For more information, see [Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI](../adminguide/cli-user-management.html).
