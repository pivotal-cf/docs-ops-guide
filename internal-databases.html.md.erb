title: Managing Internal Databases
owner: MySQL
---

This topic describes two procedures for managing the internal MySQL databases used by Pivotal Application Service (PAS) system components: scaling down your MySQL cluster, and migrating the cluster to a database stack that uses TLS encryption.

These procedures do not apply to databases configured as external in the PAS tile **Databases** pane.

PAS components that use system databases include the Cloud Controller, Diego brain, Gorouter, and the User Authorization and Authentication (UAA) server. See [Cloud Foundry Components](../concepts/architecture/index.html).


## <a id='scale-down'></a> Scale Down Your MySQL Cluster

This procedure explains how to safely scale your MySQL cluster down to a single node. If you are already running the MySQL cluster with a single node, you do not need to perform these steps.

By default, internal MySQL deploys as a single node. To take advantage of the high availability features of MySQL, you may have scaled the configuration up to three or more server nodes.

### <a id="check-health"></a> Check the Health of Your Cluster

Before scaling down your MySQL cluster, perform the following actions to ensure the cluster is healthy.

1. Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to target the API endpoint of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
	Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
	OK

	API endpoint:   http<span>s:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN... (API version: 2.54.0)
	Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
	</pre>

1. Log in with your User Account and Authentication (UAA) Administrator user credentials. Obtain these credentials by clicking the **Credentials** tab of the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile, locating the **Admin Credentials** entry in the **UAA** section, and clicking **Link to Credential**.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf login -u admin
	API endpoint: http<span>s:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN

	Password>
	Authenticating...
	OK
	</pre>

1. Create a test organization to verify the database across all nodes:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-org data-integrity-test-organization
	Creating org data-integrity-test-organization as admin...
	OK

	Assigning role OrgManager to user admin in org data-integrity-test-organization ...
	OK

	TIP: Use 'cf target -o data-integrity-test-organization' to target new org
	</pre>

1. Obtain the IP addresses of your MySQL server by performing the following steps:
  1. From the PCF **Installation Dashboard**, click the **Pivotal Application Service** tile.
  1. Click the **Status** tab.
  1. Record the IP addresses for all instances of the **MySQL Server** job.

1. Retrieve Cloud Controller database credentials from CredHub using the Ops Manager API:
	1. Perform the procedures in the [Using the Ops Manager API](../customizing/ops-man-api.html) topic to authenticate and access the Ops Manager API.
	1. Use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/products` endpoint to retrieve a list of deployed products, replacing `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` with the access token recorded in the previous step:
	  <pre class="terminal">$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products" \
	    -X GET \
	    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
	1. In the response to the above request, locate the product with an `installation_name` starting with `cf-` and copy its `guid`.
	1. Run the following `curl` command, replacing `PRODUCT-GUID` with the value of `guid` from the previous step:
	  <pre class="terminal">$ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products/PRODUCT-GUID/variables?name=cc-db-credentials" \
	    -X GET \
	    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"</pre>
	1. Record the Cloud Controller database `username` and `password` from the response to the above request.

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM. Because the procedures vary by IaaS, review the [SSH into Ops Manager](../customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) section of the Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI topic for specific instructions.

1. For each of the MySQL server IP addresses recorded above, perform the following steps from the Ops Manager VM:
	1. Query the new organization with the following command, replacing `YOUR-IP` with the IP address of the MySQL server and `YOUR-IDENTITY` with the `identity` value of the CCDB credentials obtained above:
		<pre class="terminal">
		$ mysql -h YOUR-IP -u YOUR-IDENTITY -D ccdb -p -e "select created_at, name from organizations where name = 'data-integrity-test-organization'"
		</pre>
	1. When prompted, provide the `password` value of the CCDB credentials obtained above.
	1. Examine the output of the `mysql` command and verify the `created_at` date is recent.
		<pre class="terminal">
		+---------------------+----------------------------------+
		| created_at          | name                             |
		+---------------------+----------------------------------+
		| 2016-05-28 01:11:42 | data-integrity-test-organization |
		+---------------------+----------------------------------+
		</pre>

1. If each MySQL server instance does not return the same `created_at` result, contact [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io/) before proceeding further or making any changes to your deployment. If each MySQL server instance does return the same result, then you can safely proceed to scaling down your cluster to a single node by performing the steps in the following section.

### <a id="scale-down"></a> Set Server Instance Count to 1

1. From the PCF **Installation Dashboard**, click the **Pivotal Application Service** tile.

1. Select **Resource Config**.

1. Use the dropdown to change the **Instances** count for **MySQL Server** to `1`.

1. Click **Save**, then **Review Pending Changes** and **Apply Changes** to apply the changes.

1. Delete your test organization with the following cf CLI command:
	<pre class="terminal">$ cf delete-org data-integrity-test-organization</pre>


## <a id='migrate-percona-mysql'></a> Migrating to Internal Percona MySQL

In PAS v2.1 and earlier, internal system MySQL databases ran [MariaDB](http://www.mariadb.org) with cluster nodes communicating over plaintext. PAS v2.2 offers a second option for internal databases: a [Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) that uses TLS to encrypt communication between server cluster nodes.

For more information on migrating PAS internal MySQL databases from the less secure MariaDB infrastructure to a TLS-encrypted Percona stack, see [Migrating to Internal Percona MySQL](./migrate-percona-mysql.html).
