This topic describes how to customize role-based access control (RBAC) in <%= vars.ops_manager_full %>.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

You can use RBAC to manage which operators in your organization can make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

For information about configuring <%= vars.ops_manager %> to use internal authentication or SAML authentication, see the BOSH Manager configuration topic for your IaaS:

## <a id="about"></a> Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

The diagram below illustrates the roles you can assign to determine which operators in your organization make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

<img class="no-border" src="images/roles-diagram.png" alt="Ops Manager roles diagram">

<%= vars.ops_manager %> admins can use these roles to meet the security needs of their organization. The roles provide a range of privileges that are appropriate for different types of users. For example, assign either **Restricted Control** or **Restricted View** to an operator to prevent access to all <%= vars.ops_manager %> credentials.

For more information about each role, see the table below:

| <%= vars.ops_manager %> Role | Role Definition | UAA Scope |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Administrator** | Admins can make configuration changes and click **Review Pending Changes** and **Apply Changes** in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, view credentials in the **Credentials** tab and <%= vars.ops_manager %> API endpoints, change the authentication method, and assign roles to other operators. | `opsman.admin` |
| **Full Control** | Operators can make configuration changes and click **Review Pending Changes** and **Apply Changes** in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, and view credentials in the **Credentials** tab and <%= vars.ops_manager %> API endpoints. | `opsman.full_control` |
| **Restricted Control** | Operators can make configuration changes and click **Review Pending Changes** and **Apply Changes** in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. They cannot view credentials in the **Credentials** tab or <%= vars.ops_manager %> API endpoints. | `opsman.restricted_control` |
| **Full View** | Operators can view <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration settings and view credentials in the **Credentials** tab and <%= vars.ops_manager %> API endpoints. They cannot make configuration changes or click **Apply Changes**. | `opsman.full_view` |
| **Restricted View** | Operators can view <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration settings. They cannot make configuration changes or view credentials in the **Credentials** tab or <%= vars.ops_manager %> API endpoints. | `opsman.restricted_view` |

To assign one of the above roles to an operator, see [Manage Roles with Internal Authentication](#write-internal) or [Manage Roles with SAML Authentication](#write-saml).

When you install a new <%= vars.ops_manager %> instance, all existing users have the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Administrator role by default.


## <a id="multiple-write-users"></a> Simultaneous <%= vars.ops_manager %> Admins

<%= vars.ops_manager %> allows multiple admins to log in to <%= vars.ops_manager %> simultaneously and make changes.

The interface does not provide visibility to other admins that are logged in. <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that admins communicate with each other and coordinate their changes.

### <a id="write-user-precedence"></a> Precedence for Apply Changes

Only one deployment takes precedence when two admins try to deploy around the same time.

If two admins are working at the same time, the admin who first clicks **Apply Changes** takes precedence. <%= vars.ops_manager %> overwrites all configurations made by other admins during deployment.

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends coordinating changes between admins to avoid overwriting configurations.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are having deployment issues or changes to your <%= vars.ops_manager %> are not persisting correctly, confirm that your work is not conflicting with an automated admin.</p>


## <a id="enable"></a> Enable RBAC in <%= vars.ops_manager %> After Upgrade

When you install a new instance of <%= vars.ops_manager %>, RBAC is permanently enabled by default.

If your organization has operators who are devoted to managing certain services like VMware Tanzu SQL [MySQL], you can use RBAC to assign those services operators a more restricted role.

If you upgrade from an older <%= vars.ops_manager %> instance, you must enable RBAC and assign roles to users before they can access <%= vars.ops_manager %>. If you do not assign any roles to a user, they cannot log in to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not assign roles before you enable RBAC.</p>

### <a id="enable-internal"></a> Enable RBAC with Internal Authentication

If you are upgrading from an older version of <%= vars.ops_manager %> and use internal authentication:

1. Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. From the user account menu, click **Settings**.

1. Click **Advanced**.

1. Click **Enable RBAC**. When the confirmation dialog box appears, click **Confirm and Logout**.
  <div class="note"><strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Enabling RBAC is permanent. You cannot undo this action. When you upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %>, your RBAC settings remain configured.</li>
      <li>This dialog box does not appear if RBAC is already configured. With new instances of <%= vars.ops_manager %>, RBAC is permanently configured by default.</li>
    </li>
  </div>

### <a id="enable-saml"></a> Enable RBAC with SAML Authentication

If you are upgrading from an older version of <%= vars.ops_manager %> and use SAML authentication, follow the procedures in these sections to enable RBAC. To enable RBAC in <%= vars.ops_manager %> when using SAML authentication, you must configure groups in SAML for admins and non-admins and then map the admin group to <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

#### <a id="admin-saml"></a> Step 1: Configure SAML Groups

To gather information from your SAML dashboard:

1. Log in to your SAML provider dashboard.

1. Create or identify the name of the SAML group that contains <%= vars.ops_manager %> admin users.

1. Identify the groups attribute tag you configured for your SAML server.

#### <a id="enable-om-saml"></a> Step 2: Enable RBAC in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

Follow the procedure in [Enable RBAC with Internal Authentication](#enable-internal) to configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> to recognize your SAML admin user group.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When RBAC is enabled, only users with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Administrator role can edit SAML configuration.</p>


## <a id="create-users"></a> Create User Accounts in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

To assign RBAC roles to operators, you must first create user accounts for them. For more information about creating user accounts in <%= vars.ops_manager %> with the User Account and Authentication (UAA) module, see [Creating and Managing <%= vars.ops_manager %> User Accounts](../customizing/opsman-users.html).

In addition to user accounts, you can create a client account to add to <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Client accounts manage automation tasks, such as upgrade scripts, log management, and other behaviors that might be negatively impacted if managed by a user account. You can add a client account either before initial deployment or to an existing deployment.

For more information about client accounts, see [Creating and Managing <%= vars.ops_manager %> User and Client Accounts](../customizing/opsman-users.html).


## <a id="manage-roles"></a> Manage RBAC Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

You can assign the roles defined in [Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#about) to determine which operators in your organization make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

### <a id="write-internal"></a> Manage Roles with Internal Authentication

If you configured <%= vars.ops_manager %> to use internal authentication, you can configure roles using the UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC). For more information, see [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI (UAAC)](../uaa/uaa-user-management.html).

To use the UAAC to configure roles:

1. Target your UAA server and log in as an admin by running:

    ```
    uaac target https://OPS-MANAGER-DOMAIN/uaa
    uaac token owner get
    ```
    Where `OPS-MANAGER-DOMAIN` is the domain of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

1. When prompted, enter these credentials, leaving **Client secret** blank:

    ```
    Client ID: opsman
    Client secret:
    User name: USERNAME
    Password: PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    * `USERNAME` is your username.
    * `PASSWORD` is your password.

1. To assign a role to a user, run one of these commands:
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Administrator:**

        ```
        uaac member add opsman.admin USERNAME
        ```
        Where `USERNAME` is the user to which you want to assign the role.
    * **Full Control:**

        ```
        uaac member add opsman.full_control USERNAME
        ```
        Where `USERNAME` is the user to which you want to assign the role.
    * **Restricted Control:**

        ```
        uaac member add opsman.restricted_control USERNAME
        ```
        Where `USERNAME` is the user to which you want to assign the role.
    * **Full View:**

        ```
        uaac member add opsman.full_view USERNAME
        ```
        Where `USERNAME` is the user to which you want to assign the role.
    * **Restricted View:**

        ```
        uaac member add opsman.restricted_view USERNAME
        ```
        Where `USERNAME` is the user to which you want to assign the role.

### <a id="write-saml"></a> Manage Roles with SAML Authentication

If you configured <%= vars.ops_manager %> with SAML authentication, you can assign non-admin user roles using UAAC. To assign non-admin user roles:

1. Target your UAA server and log in as an admin by running:

    ```
    uaac target https://OPS-MANAGER-DOMAIN/uaa
    uaac token sso get
    ```
    Where `OPS-MANAGER-DOMAIN` is the domain of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

1. When prompted, enter **Client ID** and **Passcode**, leaving **Client secret** blank:

    ```
    Client ID: opsman
    Client secret:
    Passcode: UAA-PASSCODE
    ```
    Where `UAA-PASSCODE` is the passcode you retrieved in the previous step.

1. Run:

    ```
    uaac group map SAML-GROUP --name 'OPS-MANAGER-SCOPE' --origin 'saml'
    ```
    Where:
    * `SAML-GROUP` is the name of the SAML group to which the user belongs.
    * `OPS-MANAGER-SCOPE` is the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UAA scope you want to assign to the user. To determine which UAA scope to use, see the table in [Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#about).

1. Add new and existing users to the appropriate SAML groups in the SAML provider dashboard. Users must log out of both <%= vars.ops_manager %> and the SAML provider for role changes to take effect.

### <a id="write-ldap"></a> Manage Roles with LDAP Authentication

If you configured <%= vars.ops_manager %> with LDAP authentication, you can assign non-admin user roles using UAAC. To assign non-admin user roles:

1. Target your UAA server and log in as an admin by running:

    ```
    uaac target https://OPS-MANAGER-DOMAIN/uaa
    uaac token sso get
    ```
    Where `OPS-MANAGER-DOMAIN` is the domain of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

1. When prompted, enter **Client ID** and **Passcode**, leaving **Client secret** blank:

    ```
    Client ID: opsman
    Client secret:
    Passcode: UAA-PASSCODE
    ```
    Where `UAA-PASSCODE` is the passcode you retrieved in the previous step.

1. Run:

    ```
    uaac group map LDAP-GROUP --name 'OPS-MANAGER-SCOPE'
    ```
    Where:
    * `LDAP-GROUP` is the name of the LDAP group to which the user belongs.
    * `OPS-MANAGER-SCOPE` is the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UAA scope you want to assign to the user. To determine which UAA scope to use, see the table in [Roles in <%= vars.ops_manager %>](#about).

1. Add new and existing users to the appropriate LDAP groups in the LDAP provider dashboard. Users must log out of both <%= vars.ops_manager %> and the LDAP provider for role changes to take effect.
