<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to troubleshoot a Windows cell in a Diego deployment.

##<a id='application-errors'></a>Resolve Application Errors

Make sure that your .NET app is ready for deployment. You usually see the following errors right after pushing an app. 

###<a id='no-compatible-cell'></a>NoCompatibleCell

![diegoWindows-no-compatible-cell](images/greenhouse/no-compatible-cell.png)

This error usually indicates that the RepService has not yet registered your Windows cell with the rest of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment. The RepService attempts to reconnect on an interval, and can sometimes resolve itself within a few minutes. 

* Restart the RepService within your cell to trigger an  immediate reconnection.

###<a id='unsucessful-start'></a>Start Unsuccessful

![diegoWindows-no-compatible-cell](images/greenhouse/start-unsucessful.png
)

This error is usually indicates that your app is misconfigured for your PCF Windows environment. 

* Push your app from a directory containing either a `.exe` binary or a valid `Web.config` file for .NET apps. 

* Or, add the `-p` flag to your `cf push` command and specify the path to the directory that contains the `.exe` or `Web.config` file.

This error can also indicate your app does not contain the required `.dll`s and dependencies. 

* Ensure that your app dependencies are contained in your pushed app.

##<a id='find-errors-hakim'></a>Find Errors with Hakim

Hakim is a diagnostic tool that reveals common configuration issues with Windows cells.

###<a id='install-hakim'></a>Install and Run Hakim

1. Download the `hakim.exe` binary to your Windows cell from your **DiegoWindows** download in the [Elastic Runtime product on Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/elastic-runtime).

2. In a shell window, navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded binary.

3. Execute the binary. Here is example hakim output:

	<pre class='terminal'>
		PS C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads> .\hakim.exe
		2016/02/26 21:04:35 The following processes are not running: garden-windows.exe
		2016/02/26 21:04:36 Failed to create container
		Post http://api/containers: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9241: ConnectEx tcp: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
	</pre>


###<a id='resolve-errors'></a>Resolve Common Errors

Hakim only outputs to the console if it detects errors. Here are some common errors and resolutions:

- `The following processes are not running:` This usually indicates a failed deployment. Re-provision your Windows components. If this does not fix this issue, contact support with the exact deployment steps followed and version of PCF deployed.

- `Failed to resolve consul host` This usually indicates interference with DNS resolution on your Windows cell. To resolve this error, set localhost 127.0.0.1 as the primary DNS server for the active network adapter.

- `Fair Share CPU Scheduling must be disabled` You must disable this setting for your Windows cell to function properly. Turn this off through the **Group Policy Management** console, and then restart your Windows cell.

- `Windows firewall service is not enabled` The DiegoWindows product enforces PCF security group settings for apps running on the cell through the Windows firewall. Apps can run without this, but security groups do not work correctly and apps have unrestricted network access.

- `There was an error detecting ntp synchronization on your machine` Clock skew with other PCF components can occur if NTP is not configured. Clock skew can result in odd errors, for example not receiving any application metrics for apps running on the affected machine.
For your Windows cell, use the same NTP server as the rest of your PCF deployment.

- `Failed to create container` This usually indicates an issue with the Windows containerization service. Contact support and provide the full output of this error.

##<a id='other'></a>Troubleshoot Other Issues

Look at the **Event Viewer** logs in Windows to troubleshoot other issues:

1. Navigate to **Windows Logs** > **Application**. 

1. Review log messages from the services running in DiegoWindows. 

1. To isolate the issue, clear the log, reproduce the issue, and review the latest messages. 

1. Include the content of these messages in your support request if you need to contact support.
