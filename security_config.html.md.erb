<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) termination for HTTP traffic in Pivotal Application Service (PAS) with a TLS certificate, as part of the process of configuring PAS for deployment. 


## <a id="ssl_term"></a> Configure TLS Termination

When you deploy PCF, you must configure the TLS termination for HTTP traffic in your PAS configuration. You can terminate TLS at all of the following points:

* Load Balancer
* Load Balancer and Gorouter
* Gorouter

Follow the guidance in [Securing Traffic into Cloud Foundry](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ssl_options) to choose and configure the TLS termination option for your deployment.

##<a id="certs"></a> Obtain TLS Certificates

To secure traffic into PCF, you must obtain at least one TLS certificate. See [Certificate Requirements](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#certtypes) for general certificate requirements for deploying PCF. The following sections describe additional IaaS-specific certificate requirements.

### <a id="aws_certs"></a> Certificate Requirements on AWS

If you are deploying PCF on AWS, then the certificate that you configure in PAS must match the certificate that you upload to AWS as a prerequisite to PCF deployment. 

### <a id="gcp_certs"></a> Certificate Requirements on GCP

If you are deploying PCF on GCP, then you must add your certificate to both the frontend configuration of your HTTP Load Balancer and to the Gorouter (PAS Router). For more information, see [Create Instance Groups and the HTTP(S) Load Balancer](../customizing/gcp-prepare-env.html#create-http-and-instance-group).

GCP load balancers actually forward both encrypted (WebSockets) and unencrypted (HTTP and TLS-terminated HTTPS) traffic to the Gorouter. When configuring the point-of-entry for a GCP deployment, select <b>Forward SSL to PAS Router</b> in your PAS network configuration. This point-of-entry selection accommodates this special characteristic of GCP deployments.

##<a id="create_or_obtain_certs"></a> Creating a Wildcard Certificate for PCF Deployments

This section describes how to create or generate a certificate for your PAS environment. If you are deploying to a production environment, you should obtain a certificate from a trusted authority (CA).

For internal development or testing environments, you have two options for creating a required TLS certificates. 

* You can create a self-signed certificate, or 
* You can have [PAS generate the certificate](#ert_certgen) for you. 

To create a certificate, you can use a wide variety of tools including OpenSSL, Java's keytool, Adobe Reader, and Apple's Keychain to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). 

In either case for either self-signed or trusted single certificates, apply the following rules when creating the CSR:

* Specify your registered wildcard domain as the `Common Name`. For example, `*.yourdomain.com`.
* If you are using a split domain setup that separates the domains for `apps` and `system` components (recommended), then enter the following values in the `Subject Alternative Name` of the certificate:
    * `*.apps.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.system.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.login.system.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.uaa.system.yourdomain.com`
* If you are using a single domain setup, then use the following values as the `Subject Alternative Name` of the certificate:
    * `*.login.system.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.uaa.system.yourdomain.com`

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: TLS certificates generated for wildcard DNS records only work for a single domain name component or component fragment. For example, a certificate generated for <code>*.EXAMPLE.com</code> does not work for <code>*.apps.EXAMPLE.com</code> and <code>*.system.EXAMPLE.com</code>. The certificate must have both <code>*.apps.EXAMPLE.com</code> and <code>*.system.EXAMPLE.com</code> attributed to it. </p>
    
### <a id="ert_certgen"></a> Generating a RSA Certificate in PAS

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **Pivotal Application Service** tile in the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Networking**.
 
1. Click **Generate RSA Certificate** to populate the **Certificate and Private Key for HAProxy and Router** fields with RSA certificate and private key information.
  
1. If you are using a split domain setup that separates the domains for `apps` and `system` components (recommended), then enter the following domains for the certificate:
    * `*.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.apps.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.system.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.login.system.yourdomain.com`
    * `*.uaa.system.yourdomain.com`
    
    For example, `*.example.com`, `*.apps.example.com`, `*.system.example.com`, `*.login.system.example.com`, `*.uaa.system.example.com`
