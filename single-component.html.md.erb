title: Understanding the Effects of Single Components on a Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Upgrade
owner: Ops Manager
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The **Resource Config** page of Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile in the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Ops Manager shows the 24 components that the Ops Manager Director installs.
You can specify the number of instances for 11 of the components.
We deliver the remaining 13 resources as single components, meaning that they have a preconfigured and unchangeable value of one instance.

In a single-component environment, upgrading can cause the deployment to experience downtime and other limitations because there is no instance redundancy.
Although this behavior might be acceptable for a test environment, you should configure the scalable components with editable instance values, such as HAProxy, Router, and DEA, for optimal performance in a production environment.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A full Ops Manager upgrade may take close to two hours, and you will have limited ability to deploy an application during this time.</p>

### Summary of Component Limitations ###

The table lists components in the order that Ops Manager upgrades each component, and includes the following columns:

* **Scalable?**: Indicates whether the component has an editable value or a preconfigured and unchangeable value of one instance.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For components marked with a checkmark in this column, we recommend that you change the preconfigured instance value of 1 to a value that best supports your production environment. For more information about scaling a deployment, refer to the [Scaling Cloud Foundry topic](../concepts/high-availability.html).
* **Extended Downtime**: Indicates that the component is unavailable for up to five minutes during an Ops Manager upgrade.
* **Other Limitations and Information**: Provides the following information:
    * Component availability, behavior, and usage during an upgrade
    * Guidance on disabling the component before an upgrade</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The table does not include the Run Smoke Tests and Run CF Acceptance Tests errands and the Compilation job. Ops Manager runs the errands after it upgrades the components, and creates compilation VMs as needed during the upgrade process.</p>
