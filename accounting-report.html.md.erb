title: Reporting App, Task, and Service Instance Usage
owner: BAM
---



This topic describes how to use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to retrieve historical system- and org-level usage information about your apps, tasks, and service instances through the Cloud Controller and Usage Service APIs.

Usage reports are compiled from the `/v2/app_usage_events` endpoint. For more information, see [List all App Usage Events](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/6.7.0/app_usage_events/list_all_app_usage_events.html) in the Cloud Foundry API documentation.

You can also access usage information by using Apps Manager. For more information, see the [Reporting Instance Usage with Apps Manager](accounting-report-apps-man.html) topic.

To retrieve current app and event information from the Cloud Controller, see [Retrieving App and Event Information](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/running/managing-cf/app-event.html) in the open-source Cloud Foundry documentation.

## <a id="prerequisite"></a> Prerequisite

Before performing the procedures in this topic, ensure that your user is a member of the `cloud_controller.admin` or `usage_service.audit` group. For example, a UAAC admin can add a user to the `usage_service.audit` group with the following command: 

<pre class="terminal">
uaac member add usage_service.audit USERNAME
</pre>


## <a id="targetcc"></a> Obtain System Usage Information

You can obtain the following system-wide usage information:

* [App Usage](#app-usage)
* [Task Usage](#task-usage)
* [Service Usage](#service-usage)
* [All Orgs App Usage](#org-usage)

### <a id='app-usage'></a> App Usage

Use `curl` to make a request to `/system_report/app_usages` on the Usage Service endpoint to show system-wide app usage data:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl "https://app-usage.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/system_report/app_usages" -k -v \
-H "authorization: `cf oauth-token`"
{
"report_time": "2017-04-11 22:28:24 UTC",
"monthly_reports": [
    {
      "month": 4,
      "year": 2017,
      "average_app_instances": 17855.256153713308,
      "maximum_app_instances": 18145,
      "app_instance_hours": 4686533.080277303
    }
  ],
"yearly_reports": [
    {
      "year": 2017,
      "average_app_instances": 16184.9,

      "app_instance_hours": 39207433.0802773
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

The following table describes the data generated by this report:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="width: 35%">Value</th>
    <th>Calculation Method</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>app_instance_hours</code></td>
    <td>The total number of hours app instances have been running on the foundation for the month or year.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>average_app_instances</code></td>
    <td>The total <code>app_instance_hours</code> on the foundation for the month or year divided by the total hours for that time period.<br><br>
    <b>Example:</b> For the month of January, 100 apps run for 300 hours each, generating a value of 30000 for <code>app_instance_hours</code>. When divided by 744, the total number of hours in January, you get a value of 40.3 for  <code>average_app_instances</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>maximum_app_instances</code></td>
    <td>The highest concurrent number of app instances running on the foundation for the month or year.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### <a id='org-usage'></a> All Orgs Usage (Beta)

The `app_usages` endpoint directly under your system domain returns system-wide app usage for all orgs that you have access to. The command works like the org-specific [App Usage](#org-app-usage) command, except you do not supply an org GUID.
You can set `order_by` to either `total_instance_hours` or `megabyte_hours`.

The `order_by` ordering defaults to ascending, which lists orgs with the most usage at the end of the output. To change the sort ordering to descending, prepend the `order_by` argument with a `-`, as in `order_by=-megabyte_hours`.

Use `curl` to make a request to `/app_usages` on the Usage Service endpoint to show system-wide organization usage data:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl "https://app-usage.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/app_usages?start=2018-010-01&end=2018-11-01&order_by=total_instance_hours" -k -v \
-H "authorization: `cf oauth-token`"
{
   "period_start":"2018-01-10T00:00:00Z",
   "period_end":"2018-11-01T23:59:59Z",
   "Organizations":[ 
      {
         "guid":"d5c9f947-df85-45af-abab-00a2174598f9",
         "total_instance_hours":"91535.6",
         "megabyte_hours":"1830712.2"
      },
      {
         "guid":"a9605fa4-99da-4932-84f5-3db8698c1fc1",
         "total_instance_hours":"99440.8",
         "megabyte_hours":"96698582.2"
      }
   ]
}

</pre>

This beta API endpoint may change; please try it out and help Pivotal make it better.


## <a id="individual_org"></a> Obtain Org Usage Information

You can obtain the following org-specific usage information:

* [App Usage](#org-app-usage)
* [Task Usage](#org-task-usage)
* [Service Usage](#org-service-usage)

You must have the GUID of the org you want to obtain information about in order to perform the procedures in this section. To retrieve your org GUID, run the `cf org` command:
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf org YOUR-ORG --guid
</pre>

### <a id='org-app-usage'></a> App Usage

Use `curl` to make a request to `/app_usages` on the Usage Service endpoint to show app usage in an org. You must complete the placeholders in `start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` to define a date range.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl "https://app-usage.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/organizations/YOUR-ORG-GUID/app_usages?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD" \
-k -v \
-H "authorization: `cf oauth-token`"
   
{
  "organization_guid": "88e485fa-2222-4993-8ef5-bac3711adfee",

      "instance_count": 1,
      "memory_in_mb_per_instance": 1024,

      "memory_in_mb_per_instance": 1024,
      "duration_in_seconds": 172800
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

You may see results with "instance_count": 0.  This happens when a v3 app is pushed but has processes that aren’t scaled up.  The memory configuration and duration are still stored and can be useful for resource management.  Apps with '0' instances are not counted in the App Usages System Report above.

### <a id='org-task-usage'></a> Task Usage

Use `curl` to make a request to `/task_usages` on the Usage Service endpoint to show task usage in an org. You must complete the placeholders in `start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` to define a date range.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In the <code>/task_usages</code> endpoint, <code>memory_in_mb_per_instance</code> is the memory of the task.</p> 

### <a id='org-service-usage'></a> Service Usage

## <a id="usage-availability"></a> Usage Availability

The app, task, and service instance usage data returned from the Usage Service is delayed to ensure accuracy. The `/usage_availability` endpoint can be used to retrieve the date which the Usage Service data is accurate to. The Usage Service is able to provide data for time periods up to and including this date.

Use the following curl command to retrieve the current usage availability timestamp:

```
curl "https://app-usage.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/usage_availability" -k -v
{"date":"2019-01-01"}
```

Where `YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the system domain of your PAS environment. 

## <a id="monitor-usage-service"></a> Monitor Usage Service

Pivotal recommends monitoring usage service at regular intervals with a recurring CI task or 3rd party monitoring tool. Usage service runs asynchronous jobs such as fetching usage events from the Cloud Controller API. 

Use the following curl command to check for failed jobs:

```
$ curl "https://app-usage.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/heartbeat/failed_jobs" -k -v
Ok.
```

By default, the `error_threshold` is set to 1 and the command does the following:

* Succeeds with HTTP status `200` if the number of failed jobs is lower than the threshold
* Fails with HTTP status `500` if it exceeds the threshold

The following example specifies a threshold value:

```
$ curl "https://app-usage.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN/heartbeat/failed_jobs?error_threshold=5" -k -v
Ok.
```


## <a id="database-example"></a> Example: Autogenerated Database Usage Reports

For security compliance and record keeping, some <%= vars.product_name %> customers create Concourse CI/CD pipelines that regularly run JavaScript scripts to do the following: 

1. Call the `app-usage` APIs in the above sections of this topic, as well as the [Security Event Logging](../loggregator/cc-uaa-logging.html) topic, to collect data about service instances from a <%= vars.product_name %> foundation. This data includes database instance information such as tile or database type, database creator, and date of creation or deletion.

1. Merge and format the data about services instances into a JSON output file and save it to an S3 bucket. 

1. Input the file to another process that does the following:
  1. Parses the data
  1. Eliminates duplicate entries from previous reports 
  1. Sends the data to a database compliance system through APIs
